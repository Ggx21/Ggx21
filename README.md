# 👋 Hi, I’m @Ggx21

I'm a passionate **computer science student** at **Tsinghua University** with a deep interest in **network security, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and software development**. I'm currently focusing on **SDN, network performance optimization**, and **AI model robustness**.

- 👀 **I’m interested in**:
  - **Network security** (e.g., Spectre attack, cache-based side-channel attacks)
  - **Software-defined networking (SDN)** with **Open vSwitch (OVS)** and **VXLAN**
  - **Low-level networking** (e.g., SOCKS5 protocol, Tor network performance, packet forwarding)
  - **Artificial intelligence** (e.g., machine learning, deep learning, and AI model security)
  - **C++ and Python programming** (network programming, socket communication, data forwarding)

- 🌱 **I’m currently learning**:
  - Advanced **AI model explainability**, focusing on improving **model robustness** and defending against **adversarial attacks**.
  - Network performance optimization, including **testing Tor network performance** and experimenting with **advanced OVS configurations**.
  - **Compiler design** with a focus on building a frontend for **Antlr** and **AST generation**.

- 💞️ **I’m looking to collaborate on**:
  - Projects related to **network security** (e.g., experimenting with side-channel attacks and mitigating vulnerabilities).
  - **Machine learning** projects, particularly those focused on **robust AI models** and **explainable AI**.
  - **Networking projects** involving **SDN, VXLAN**, and performance optimization, especially those requiring hands-on implementation.

- 📫 **How to reach me**:
